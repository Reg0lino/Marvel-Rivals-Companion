**Your unofficial companion app and information resource for the Marvel Rivals 6v6 hero shooter!**

This project aims to be a comprehensive hub for players looking for the latest game information, developer updates, patch notes, balance changes, and eventually, detailed character sheets for the heroes and villains of Marvel Rivals.

Think of it as "vibe coding" a useful tool for the community – building it out as the game evolves and as we figure out the best ways to gather and present information.

## Project Goal

To create a reliable, easy-to-use resource for Marvel Rivals players that centralizes key information about the game. This includes:

*   Keeping track of the latest official news and announcements.
*   Summarizing developer insights and patch notes.
*   Providing details on hero abilities, balance changes, and potential meta shifts.
*   Eventually offering detailed, filterable character sheets (the "character sheet" aspect is a core long-term goal).

---

## Current Features (Stable Build)

The current `main` or `stable` branch of this project offers a working version based on **manually curated data**. This includes:

*   **Game Overview:** Basic description of Marvel Rivals gameplay and features.
*   **News Feed:** Summaries of recent official news posts.
*   **Announcements:** Highlights of key official announcements (events, season starts, etc.).
*   **Balance Summaries:** Key takeaways from the latest balance patches.
*   **Dev Diary Insights:** Summaries of developer communications (like the "Dev Vision" series).
*   **Game Update Notes:** High-level overview of recent game patches.
*   **Community Meta Snapshot:** A generated overview based on observed community discussion (e.g., Reddit, forums) regarding popular strategies or hero perceptions.

✅ **This stable version provides useful, albeit manually updated, information.**

## Development Status & API Version

This project is under active development, with a key focus on transitioning from manually updated data to automated data fetching via APIs (official or community-driven, if/when they become available).

*   **Stable Build (`main` / `stable` branch):** Functional, uses static data files (e.g., Markdown files in an `/info` directory). Requires manual updates to stay current. **This is the recommended version for reliable information currently.**
*   **Development Build (`develop` / `api` branch):** **Work in Progress!** This branch focuses on building the infrastructure to:
    *   Potentially scrape official websites (with respect to their `robots.txt` and ToS).
    *   Integrate with any future official or unofficial Marvel Rivals APIs.
    *   Parse and display live data automatically.
    *   Build more dynamic character sheet generation features.

⚠️ **The API-driven version is experimental and likely unstable. Expect bugs, missing data, and frequent changes on this development branch.**

---

## How It Works

*   **Stable Build:** Reads information directly from pre-formatted text or Markdown files located within the repository (e.g., in an `/info` folder). These files are updated manually by contributors based on official game news and patch notes.
*   **API Build (Future):** Aims to use scripts (likely Python) to fetch data from external sources, parse it, and potentially store it in a more structured format (like JSON) or display it directly via a web interface (using JavaScript/HTML).

---

## Getting Started (Using the Stable Build)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/<YourRepoName>.git
    cd <YourRepoName>
    ```
2.  **Ensure you are on the `main` or `stable` branch.**
3.  **Access the Information:**
    *   **(Method 1: Direct File Access)** Navigate to the `/info` (or similarly named) directory within the cloned repository. You can open the `.md` or `.txt` files directly to read the curated information.
    *   **(Method 2: Run Local Viewer - if applicable)** If the project includes a simple local viewer (e.g., a basic Python script or HTML page), follow the instructions provided within that branch's README or documentation to run it. (e.g., `python view_info.py` or open `index.html` in your browser).

---

## Technology Stack (Conceptual)

*   **Stable Build:** Primarily Markdown (`.md`) or plain text (`.txt`) for data storage. May include simple scripts (Python, Shell) for organization or viewing.
*   **API Build (Anticipated):**
    *   **Backend/Scraping:** Python (using libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`)
    *   **Data Storage:** JSON, potentially a simple database.
    *   **Frontend (Optional):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte) for a web-based interface.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can help:

1.  **Keep Stable Data Updated:** Submit Pull Requests to update the information files in the `main`/`stable` branch when new patches, news, or dev diaries are released. This is crucial for keeping the current version useful!
2.  **Report Issues:** Find a bug or outdated information? Open an issue!
3.  **Suggest Features:** Have ideas for improving the tool or new information to track? Let us know via Issues.
4.  **Develop the API Version:** If you have experience with web scraping, API integration, or frontend development, contributions to the `develop`/`api` branch are highly encouraged (but please coordinate via Issues first).

Please read our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (if available) for more detailed guidelines.

## Future Plans / Roadmap

*   **Stabilize API Data Fetching:** Get the automated data retrieval working reliably.
*   **Develop Dynamic Character Sheets:** Create detailed views for each hero, pulling stats and ability info automatically.
*   **Implement Filtering/Searching:** Allow users to easily find specific information.
*   **Improve UI/UX:** Make the tool more user-friendly, especially if a web interface is developed.
*   **Track More Data:** Potentially incorporate community-gathered stats (pick rates, win rates) if reliable sources emerge.
*   **Explore Localization:** Support for multiple languages if feasible.
